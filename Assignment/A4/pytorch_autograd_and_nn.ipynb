        "In addition 1.0 also separates a Tensor's datatype from its device, and uses numpy-style factories for constructing Tensors rather than directly invoking Tensor constructors.\n",
        "Now, to obtain gradients for a tensor via autograd from arbitrary scalar valued functions, you can simply set `requires_grad=True`.\n",

PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS!

You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor.
